"Zed projects offer a dedicated UI for toolchain selection, which lets you "
"pick a set of tools for working with a given language in a current project."

"Imagine you're working with Python project, which has virtual environments "
"that encapsulate a set of dependencies of your project along with a suitable "
"interpreter to run it with. The language server has to know which virtual "
"environment you're working with, as it uses it to understand your project's "
"code. With toolchain selector, you don't need to spend time configuring your "
"language server to point it at the right virtual environment directory—you "
"can just select the right virtual environment (toolchain) from a dropdown."

#: src/toolchains.md:8

"You can even select different toolchains for different subprojects within "
"your Zed project. A definition of a subproject is language-specific. In "
"collaborative scenarios, only the project owner can see and modify an active "
"toolchain."

"In [remote projects](./remote-development.md), you can use the toolchain "
"selector to control the active toolchain on the SSH host. When [sharing your "
"project](./collaboration/overview.md), the toolchain selector is not "

#: src/toolchains.md:15
msgid ""
"The active toolchain is relevant for launching language servers, which may "
"need it to function properly—it may not be able to resolve dependencies, "
"which in turn may make functionalities like \"Go to definition\" or \"Code "
"completions\" unavailable."
msgstr ""

#: src/toolchains.md:17
msgid ""
"The active toolchain is also relevant when launching a shell in the terminal "
"panel: some toolchains provide \"activation scripts\" for shells, which make "
"those toolchains available in the shell environment for your convenience. "
"Zed will run these activation scripts automatically when you create a new "
"terminal."
msgstr ""

#: src/toolchains.md:19
msgid ""
"This also applies to [tasks](./tasks.md)—Zed tasks behave \"as if\" you "
"opened a new terminal tab and ran a given task invocation yourself, which in "
"turn means that Zed task execution is affected by the active toolchain and "
"its activation script."

"The active toolchain (if there is one) is displayed in the status bar (on "

"select</code>)."

"Zed will automatically infer a set of toolchains to choose from based on the "
"project you're working with. A default will also be selected on your behalf "
"on a best-effort basis when you open a project for the first time."

#: src/toolchains.md:27
msgid ""
"The toolchain selection applies to a current subproject, which—depending on "
"the structure of your Zed project—might be your whole project or just a "
"subset of it. For example, if you have a monorepo with multiple subprojects, "
"you might want to select a different toolchain for each subproject."

"selector. From there you can provide a path to a toolchain and set a name of "
"your liking for it."
