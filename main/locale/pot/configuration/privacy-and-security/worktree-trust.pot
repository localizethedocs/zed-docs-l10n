"A worktree in Zed is either a directory or a single file that Zed opens as a "
"standalone \"project\". Zed opens a worktree every time `zed some/path` is "
"invoked, on drag and dropping a file or directory into Zed, on opening user "
"settings.json, etc."

"Every worktree opened may contain a `.zed/settings.json` file with extra "
"configuration options that may require installing and spawning language "
"servers or MCP servers. In order to provide users the opportunity to make "
"their own choices according to their unique threat model and risk tolerance, "
"all worktrees will be started in Restricted mode, which prevents download "
"and execution of any related items from `.zed/settings.json`. Until "
"configured to trust the worktree(s), Zed will not perform any related "
"untrusted actions and will wait for user confirmation. This gives users a "
"chance to review and understand any pre-configured settings, MCP servers, or "
"language servers associated with a project."

"After opening an empty Zed it's possible to open just a file, same as after "
"opening a directory in Zed it's possible to open a file outside of this "

"open, which originates from a newly created, single file worktree."

"Spawning a language server presents a risk should the language server "

"When a directory worktree is trusted, language and MCP servers are permitted "
