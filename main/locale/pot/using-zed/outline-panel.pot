"In addition to the modal outline (`cmd-shift-o`), Zed offers an outline "
"panel. The outline panel can be deployed via `cmd-shift-b` (`outline panel: "
"toggle focus` via the command palette), or by clicking the `Outline Panel` "
"button in the status bar."

"When viewing a \"singleton\" buffer (i.e., a single file on a tab), the "
"outline panel works similarly to that of the outline modal－it displays the "
"outline of the current buffer's symbols, as reported by tree-sitter. "
"Clicking on an entry allows you to jump to the associated section in the "
"file. The outline view will also automatically scroll to the section "
"associated with the current cursor position within the file."
