"In order to still have a useful environment, Zed spawns a login shell in the "

"Since that can lead to problems for users that require different environment "
"variables for a project (because they use `direnv`, or `asdf`, or "
"`mise`, ... in that project), when opening project, Zed spawns another login "
"shell. This time in the project's directory. The environment from that login "
"shell is _not_ set on the process (because that would mean opening a new "
"project changes the environment for all Zed windows). Instead, the "
"environment is stored and passed along when running tasks, opening "
