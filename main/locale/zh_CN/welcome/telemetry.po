"Crash reports consist of a [minidump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/"

"We've built dashboards that allow us to visualize the frequency and severity "
"of issues experienced by users. Having these reports sent automatically "
"allows us to begin implementing fixes without the user needing to file a "
"report in our issue tracker. The plots in the dashboards also give us an "
"informal measurement of the stability of Zed."
