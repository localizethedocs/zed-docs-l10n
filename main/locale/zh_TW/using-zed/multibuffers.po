"One of the superpowers Zed gives you is the ability to edit multiple files "
"simultaneously. When combined with multiple cursors, this makes wide-ranging "

"Editing a multibuffer is the same as editing a normal file. Changes you make "
"will be reflected in the open copies of that file in the rest of the editor, "
"and you can save all files with `editor: Save` (bound to `cmd-s` on macOS, "
"`ctrl-s` on Windows/Linux, or `:w` in Vim mode)."

"When in a multibuffer, it is often useful to use multiple cursors to edit "
"every file simultaneously. If you want to edit a few instances, you can "
"select them with the mouse (`option-click` on macOS, `alt-click` on Window/"
"Linux) or the keyboard. `cmd-d` on macOS, `ctrl-d` on Windows/Linux, or `gl` "
"in Vim mode will select the next match of the word under the cursor."

"When you want to edit all matches you can select them by running the "
"`editor: Select All Matches` command (`cmd-shift-l` on macOS, `ctrl-shift-l` "

"While you can easily edit files in a multibuffer, navigating directly to the "
"source file is often beneficial. You can accomplish this by clicking on any "
"of the divider lines between excerpts or by placing your cursor in an "
"excerpt and executing the `editor: open excerpts` command. It’s key to note "
"that if multiple cursors are being used, the command will open the source "
"file positioned under each cursor within the multibuffer."

"Additionally, if you prefer to use the mouse and would like to double-click "
"on an excerpt to open it, you can enable this functionality with the "

"To start a search run the `pane: Toggle Search` command (`cmd-shift-f` on "
"macOS, `ctrl-shift-f` on Windows/Linux, or `g/` in Vim mode). After the "
"search has completed, the results will be shown in a new multibuffer. There "
"will be one excerpt for each matching line across the whole project."
