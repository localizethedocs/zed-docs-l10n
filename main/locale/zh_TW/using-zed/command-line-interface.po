"Zed has a CLI, on Linux this should come with the distribution's Zed package "
"(binary name can vary from distribution to distribution, `zed` will be used "
"later for brevity). For macOS, the CLI comes in the same package with the "
"editor binary, and could be installed into the system with the `cli: "
"install` Zed command which will create a symlink to the `/usr/local/bin/"
"zed`. It can also be built from source out of the `cli` crate in this "
"repository."
