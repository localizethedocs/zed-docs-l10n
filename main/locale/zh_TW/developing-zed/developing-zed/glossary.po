"`App`: A singleton which holds the full application state including all the "

"`Context`: A wrapper around the `App` struct with specialized behavior for a "

"takes an `AsyncFnOnce(AsyncApp) -> Ret`, whereas `Context::spawn` takes an "

"been terminated by the time this closure runs). The convenience of "
"`AsyncApp` lies in the fact that you usually interface with `App` via `&mut "
