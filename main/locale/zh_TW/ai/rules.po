"A rule is essentially a prompt that is inserted at the beginning of each "
"interaction with the Agent. Currently, Zed supports adding rules through "
"files inserted directly in the worktree or through the Rules Library, which "
"allows you to store multiple rules for constant or on-demand usage."
